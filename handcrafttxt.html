        <h3>What is Konadapalli Toys?</h3>
        <p>
            Southern India is known for its beautiful traditional wooden toys. The Kondapalli toys of Andhra Pradesh are a part of one such long tradition of making traditional toys. The origins of these toys date back centuries- the craft was said to have started when Rajasthani toy makers migrated to Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh in the sixteenth century, with the incentive of patronage by the local king of the Reddy clan.
             This legend originates from the fact that the toys closely resemble Rajasthani crafts of this period.

            While Kondapalli toys look deceptively simple, making them is not an easy process. The most distinctive of their features include the vibrant colours and their surprisingly light weights- this is because they are made only with a light weight wood called ‘Tella Panki’. Pieces of this wood undergo a long and slow heat treatment process to rid it of any moisture, 
            giving the toys their distinctive ultra-light weight characteristic.
             The different components of the toys are then carved separately and attached with a glue made of tamarind seed paste. After the toys are attached and assembled, they are carved and attached, the artisans smooth out the surface of the toys using a paste made of water, tamarind seed paste and sawdust and sand it till they get the desired result.

        <h3>What is Kalamakari Crafts?</h3>
        <p>
            
From 17th century temples to stretched canvases in modern homes, Kalamkari is a time-honored and widely beloved form of traditional Indian art. In fact to me, Kalamkari is a reminder of how art is integral to our sense of fulfillment and wellbeing, how it is synonymous with culture and tradition. I firmly believe that art is unique in its ability to connect us to our humanity and our history — and as a distinctly Indian craft,
 Kalamkari is intertwined with our iconography and mythologies.
 Kalamkari originated in the modern-day states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana several hundred years ago. 
 It was first used to portray scenes from sacred texts such as the Mahabharata, Ramayana and Bhagavatam. These paintings were often displayed as decorative backdrops in temples, depicting the stories of deities.

            Unfortunately, like many forms of traditional Indian art, Kalamkari is a generational art,
             meaning that typically a father or grandfather would train his children in the family trade. 
             It has been preserved and passed down for many generations in this way. But now, given the plethora of career options available to make a steadier and more lucrative income, the children of most Kalamkari artists pursue careers in engineering, business or other fields. There are only about 16 remaining skilled Kalamkari artists living and working today, 10 of whom have won National Awards.

            In fact, one of my motivations for founding Laasya Art was to encourage a new wave of appreciation and support for traditional craft artists,
             and I hope that this special art form will be preserved for future generations to enjoy.
