            Bandaru Laddu
            
            Bandaru Laddu is also known as Thokudu Laddu – one of Andhra’s most favorite sweet. They are originated in a place called “Machilipatnam” in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The so-called modern day Machilipatnam used to be called “Bandaru”. Hence the name Bandaru Laddu.  These laddus made by pounding the fried besan murukus. In the Telugu language which is spoken in the state of Andhra Pradesh Pounding is called tokkudu. Hence the name Tokkudu Laddu. Bandaru laddu, with its striking and smooth velvety texture melt right in your mouth. You are lucky to find these laddus in sweet stalls. Only until recent years these are only made at home, never in sweet stalls. In addition to its delectable taste, bandaru laddu will wow you with its long shelf life. Bandaru laddu will stay fresh for three to four weeks, which can be extended by refrigerating and avoiding milk in the recipe.
            
            The right creamy melt in the mouth texture comes from pounding the mix in an appropriate stone pestle. Though there are many cut short methods to make these, they don’t yield good results. This is a recipe i got from my elders in the family which has been followed for more than 2 decades and are prepared during weddings and other auspicious occasions.
